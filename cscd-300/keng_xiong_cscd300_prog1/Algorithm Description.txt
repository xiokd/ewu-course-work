Using the similar concept of the standard binary search method, the methods used for the modified 
binary search divides the array into halves to efficiently search a given array.

To find the leftmost index, the binary search method is modified to where it will always 
check the left side of the middle index for every time the array is divided doing additional 
condition checking after the initial conditions have be checked first. To check the left side, 
you subtract one from the middle index's number to recieve the index on the left side of it and 
then compare element contained in that index to the user's desired number. Then adjust the high 
and low index values accordingly.

To find the rightmost index, a similar process as the leftmost index is applied. The process is 
similar however instead of checking the left side of the middle index, you check the right.
Following the same process as before, additional conditions are checked after the initial
conditions are checked. To check the element on the right side of the middle index, you add
one to the middle index's number and then compare the element in that index to the user's
desired number. The high and low index values are then adjusted accordingly.

The purpose of the modification of checking the neighboring indexes is to make sure they are 
included in the range.
